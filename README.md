NantRun
=======

An NAnt script visualizer and runner
During the days I was working on build automation, I realized it would have been amazing if I could run my build scripts in an easier fashion rather than from command line. It was hard keeping track of property definitions and which ones I wanted to set and so on. I decided to write this to help me do this. Later on, I decided to make it help with scripting NAnt files (haven't completed that part yet. I have some designs in mind though). I am not focusing on this because competitors like NAntPad, NantBuilder 2 and Editor4NAnt currently look very good. I will work on this again when I can surpass them.
